1. WAP to generate a sqaure wave on P1.5 with 50% DutyCycle. Program timers in mode0, mode1 and mode2 to generate delay.

2. WAP to generate a rectangular wave with T(on)=20ms and T(off)=40ms. Use Timer0 in mode0, mode1 and mode2 to generate delay.

3. Repeat above problems to generaate square wave and rectangular wave with interrupts for timers

4. Repeat above problems of status check and interrupt methods to generate square wave and rectangular wave using embedded c programs.
