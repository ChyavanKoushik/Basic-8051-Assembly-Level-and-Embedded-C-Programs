1. Write an ALP to count the number of even and odd numbers in an array of N bytes of data

2. Write an ALP to count the number of positive and negative numbers in an array of N bytes of data

3. Check whether the given byte of data is present in an array of N bytes of data. If present send 00 to port0 else send FF to port0

4. Read the data of port1. If p1.1 is at logic 0, find the largest number in an array of N bytes of data and store in location 40h. If p1.1 is at logic 1, find the smallest number in the array and store in location 40h.
